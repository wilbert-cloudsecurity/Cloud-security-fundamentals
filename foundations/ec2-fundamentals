# EC2 Fundamentals

## Why EC2 Matters
Amazon EC2 provides scalable virtual servers in the cloud and is one of the core services in AWS infrastructure.

## What I Practiced
- Launched an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console
- Selected AMI and instance type
- Configured key pair for SSH access
- Terminated the instance to understand the lifecycle

# Instance Lifecycle

## States
- Pending
- Running
- Stopped
- Terminated

Understanding these states is essential for cost control and resource management.

# SSH Access

## Secure Connection
- Used a private key (.pem)
- Connected via SSH from the terminal
- Applied correct permissions (chmod 600)

## Why It Matters
EC2 is foundational for understanding cloud infrastructure, server management, and secure remote access in AWS environments.
