# Shared Responsibility Model

Cloud security is a shared effort between the cloud provider and the customer.

The provider secures the infrastructure, while the customer is responsible for
configuring services securely, managing identities, and protecting data.

Understanding this model helps prevent common security mistakes in cloud
environments.
